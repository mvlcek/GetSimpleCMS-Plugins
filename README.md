# GetSimpleCMS-Plugins

[GetSimple CMS](http://get-simple.info/) is a great content management system that stores all data 
in text files and does not need any database.

It is extensible by plugins and this repository contains the plugins authored by me.
The releases can be downloaded from the [GetSimple Extend Repository](http://get-simple.info/extend/a/mvlcek).

For detailed descriptions of the plugins see

 * http://mvlcek.bplaced.net/get-simple
 * the [discussion forum](http://get-simple.info/forums/) of GetSimple: most plugins in the [GetSimple Extend Repository](http://get-simple.info/extend/a/mvlcek) 
contain a link to the relevant topic.
